            <p class="bang">It all started with the Big Bang, the monumental event that marks the birth of our universe. Around 13.8 billion years ago, everything we know was packed into an incredibly hot and dense point. Suddenly, this singularity began expanding, not as an explosion, but as the rapid stretching of space itself.
                In the moments that followed, the universe cooled and atoms began to form. Over billions of years, these atoms gathered to create stars and galaxies, shaping the cosmos into the vast expanse we see today.

Evidence for the Big Bang includes the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which is the afterglow of this ancient explosion, and the fact that the universe is still expanding.

The Big Bang set the stage for everything from the formation of galaxies to the birth of stars and planets. Itâ€™s the beginning of our cosmic story and a key to understanding the universe's past, present, and future.
